Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered)
Conceptual Understanding:
 
Onion Architecture: (Yes/No) 
 
Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?
No, but I have heard about Onion Architecture and its purpose but I have no idea on implementing it properly in programming projects.

MVC Pattern: (Yes/No) 

Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
Yes, I may have learned about it but I don't know how to apply on programming.
 
Web API: (Yes/No) 

Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?
No, I haven't hear of ASP.NET Core Web API to build Restful APIs.


Application & Bottlenecks:
Onion Architecture:

Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
1.Separation of concerns
2.Testability: 
3.Maintainability

Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)
Onion Architecture in .NET Core promotes cleaner, more testable applications by separating concerns and promoting loose coupling between layers.

Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)
Yes, I did encounter a lot of challenges regarding with Onion Architecture as I'm only doing things I have no clear information regarding the ASP.MVC & how to apply the onion architecture for the given projects. 
 

MVC:

Components: (1-3 keywords each)
1.Model
2.View
3.Controller

Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.
1. Model: Represents the data and core logic of your application. It handles data access, business rules, and any calculations needed.
2. View: Focuses on how the data is presented to the user. It doesn't contain any application logic, just the UI elements that display information.
3. Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input, updates the Model as needed, and instructs the View on how to update itself based on changes in the Model.

Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)
Yes, I have a slight idea of its purpose but on how to connect it is my problem or challenges I have encountered on MVC projects.

Web API:
I don't have any idea about WEB API

Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.
I cannot differentiate the two because of my lack of understanding about Web API
 
Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)
I have not encountered any bottlenecks at the moment since I do not have the proper understanding of both.
